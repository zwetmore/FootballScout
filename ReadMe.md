## Football-Data-Analysis

This is a work in progress project for analyzing football data.
I am not uploading the data to github as it is private to Medford Football.
Without data it will not run. However, it still illustrates my process of data analysis.
Emphasizing, this is not a finished product.

## Setup
Run the following commands to activate the virtual environment (macOS/Linux):
```
python3 -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate
```

Run the following command to install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
