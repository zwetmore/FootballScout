## Football-Data-Analysis

This is a work in progress project for analyzing football data.
I am not uploading the data to github as it is private to Medford Football.

Run the following commands to activate the virtual environment (macOS/Linux):
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Run the following command to install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
