## **Football Data Analysis**  

This project is a **work in progress** focused on analyzing football data. While the dataset itself is **private to Medford Football** and not uploaded to GitHub, the repository showcases my **data analysis workflow**, including ETL processes, data cleaning, preprocessing, and statistical analysis.  

âš  **Note:** Without the dataset, the scripts will not execute fully, but they still provide insight into my approach and methodology.
